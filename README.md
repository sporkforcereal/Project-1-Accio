Sending large file was an issue so I had to chop it up and send 1024 bytes at a time.

I've been using a lot of stack overflow and used the learning center as resources.
Especially the cplusplus.com

In the end, I was just not able to figure out multi-threading. I REALLY wish you'd go over the codes as well because no one in this building is familiar with C++. I also don't understand why we have to code in C++ when the textbook is LITERALLY written in python, having us learn socks and C++ didn't help.

P.S. 
I went to the learning center, and basically NO ONE knows how to do C++ with sockets and stuff, there was one guy able to help me, but he only knows C and still not familiar with the sockets using C++. So I'm not sure when you said the learning center can help with it, because the all the TA asked each other and no one knew how to do tcp stuff over c++.
